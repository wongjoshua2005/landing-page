The project focuses on recreating a specific webpage from The Odin Project
curriculum.

Reflection after finishing the project: I am starting to understand the
fundamentals of CSS and flexbox in general. I am still trying to figure out
better ways to organize my CSS containers and ensuring better visuals, but 
I am proud of what I have accomplished in almost a month. I will keep on
learning more CSS and start learning JavaScript!
